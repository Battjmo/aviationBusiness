Aviation Business: A Spiritual Successor to Aerobiz Supersonic

Q: Ummm okay, what the hell was Aerobiz Supersonic?

A: Aerobiz Supersonic is a 1993 turn-based multiplayer economic strategy game by Koei Tecmo Games. It is the vastly expanded sequel to 1992’s Aerobiz. It was one of a large family of deep turn-based strategy games Koei develop for the SNES, including the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, Nobunaga’s Ambition series, and Liberty or Death.

Q: Whaddaya do?

A: Four players, each controlled by either an AI or a human in any combination (yes, the game can play itself) each control an airline that starts with only a hub city, some planes, and no routes, set in one of four 20-year periods covering the history of publically accessible air travel. They vie for supremacy by cultivating routes, acquiring side businesses, managing and expanding a fleet of aircraft, and running marketing campaigns, among other tasks. The first player to achieve all of the game’s four victory conditions and hold them for a year wins, or failing that, whomever has gotten the closest at the end of 20 years, or 80 in-game rounds.

Q: Sounds aight, but that’s already a game yeah?

A: It sure is. However, it’s a game available for two cartridge-based systems that was released in 1993. That was 26 years ago. We feel that it is high time for someone to take this formula and update it.

Q: Surely there are good reasons that hasn’t happened already?

A: There sure are. Dense turn-based multiplayer games have always been a tough sell. Even the venerable civilization has failed to thrive as a multiplayer game. However, for 20 years, Aerobiz has held a unique appeal for myself and those around me. It is the only multiplayer economic strategy video game, real-time or turn-based, that has grabbed anyone with much vigor, and its appeal has extended from hardcore gamers through punk rockers who hadn’t touched a game in their lives. We believe this is a winning formula, and one worth reviving with modern technology and a further 26 years of insight into what makes a fun game.

Q: So what’s your game gonna be?

A: We love Aerobiz, and want to remain as faithful to what made it great as possible. Much like ConcernedApe did with Harvest Moon / Stardew Valley, we hope to take a style of game that is both great and forgotten in modern game development and bring it back the the fore. 

Q: What does that look like?

A: Four players will each control a rival… transportation system of some kind. The original Aerobiz games got licenses from every major aircraft manufacturer of the time, including Tupolev and Ilyushin from the USSR. We may not be able to do that. 

Q: That seems like a problem. The historical events and real planes from the original game probably anchored the thematic connection players felt to it.

A: That may be the case. However, it is a problem that can be addressed once we have a fun prototype. The historical settings, veering into a lightly sci-fi future as the original did, can be implemented regardless.

Q: KK, so what are you actually doing differently from Aerobiz?

A: A few noteworthy things:

Online multiplayer. The original game plays like a board game that would be very difficult to physically replicate, which lends itself to local multiplayer, and that will certainly be allowed, but online play should expand our audience substantially.
Browser-based play: technological advancements since the release of the first game, including the very existence of JavaScript, could enable the game to be playable in-browser, widening the audience even further.
Tutorial: The original game was obtuse in a way that would be extremely off-putting to modern players. Nearly nothing was explained, and even after 15 years of playing the game some of its intricacies are lost on me. Some of this is good, to an extent, as discovery is an extremely valuable part of any video game design. However, we would do much more than the original developers did to make the game accessible to new players via a tutorial campaign, playable by multiple players at once. 
Business Intelligence: in addtion to the tutorial, the game will also include documentation that is unlocked over time: as the players experiment with new features and time passes, information about them will be revealed. Some of it may not be enitrely accurate or complete. It shouldn’t lie, but could be misleading, and even possibly be algorithmically generated so that different players get different intelligence in different playthroughs. Nothing is sure in business, after all.
So what’s it gonna be?

Player Count: 0 - 4 (depending on whether we can actually write an AI)

Platform: Browser, possibly more later.

Beyond that, I think a lot of good work here has already been done for us. Aerobiz is an awesome game to which we should remain pretty darn faithful, as that’s the thesis of this whole project, minus the changes mentioned in the previous section.



Alternate mobile friendly idea:

DeX game with flinging planes around like angry birds. Get money for getting them to their destination, more for longer and higher value, can knock other ppl's planes.

Could be real time or turn based. Money could be banked for points or used to buy upgrades like more durable planes, faster planes.

Could also ditch angry birds style flinging and make it more of a clicker, especially in the proto stage.
